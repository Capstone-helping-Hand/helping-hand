# Helping Hands
Helping Hands is a paired programming project that allows users to either put an item up for donation or request for an item thatâ€™s needed. Users can create an account with a role, have full CRUD functionality with item request and donation posts, and see these listed items update in realtime as they are either created or claimed. Helping Hands is an MVC application built using Java and the Spring Framework.
